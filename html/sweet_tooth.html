            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Sweet Tooth is an American fantasy drama streaming television series developed by Jim Mickle. It is based
                on the comic book of the same name by Jeff Lemire and premiered on Netflix on June 4, 2021. In July
                2021, the series was renewed for a second season. <br> <br>
                Ten years ago in "The Great Crumble", society collapsed due to a viral pandemic of a disease known as
                the Sick, wiping out most of the world's human population, and leading to the mysterious emergence of
                hybrid babies that are born part human, part animal. <br> <br>

                Unsure whether hybrids are the cause of the virus or a result of the virus, many humans fear and hunt
                the hybrids. Gus, a half-deer hybrid, lives in the wilderness with his father â€“ who dies when Gus is
                nine years old. Gus discovers a box buried by his father beneath a tree; the box contains what Gus
                believes is a photograph of his mother, with the word "Colorado" written on it. <br> <br>

                A year after his father's death, Gus sets a fire before deciding to leave his and his father's house in
                the wilderness to find his mother. The fire alerts nearby hunters to his location, and they try to kill
                Gus for sport. However, when Gus speaks, the hunters are visibly startled. The hunters are then killed
                by Tommy Jepperd, "Big Man", a lone traveller, who afterwards tries to leave Gus behind, but Gus follows
                him. Gus keeps insisting that Jepperd will escort him to Colorado to find his mother. Jepperd resists,
                but he ends up protecting Gus, who won't leave him alone. <br> <br>

                The story also follows Dr. Aditya Singh as he and his wife try to find a cure for the Sick, and Aimee, a
                former therapist who tries to protect her sanctuary for hybrids, which is called "The Preserve".
